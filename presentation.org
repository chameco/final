#+title: 11/27/18 Design Presentation
#+author: Samuel Breese and Jordan Alligood

* Introduction
- Implementation in Haskell
- Using advanced type-level features to abstract over ciphers and hashes
* Status of implementation
- RSA and SHA-1 implemented fully
  - Miller-Rabin for primality testing
- SDES ported to common interface for brute-force attack
- Currently debugging SHA-256 implementation
* Future implementation plans
- ElGamal and ECC (fun, fairly easy)
- A good block cipher (harder)
  - Probably Triple-DES
- Some PRNGs for stream ciphers
  - Using ~/dev/random~ for RSA prime generation, etc.
- Deriving instances of cipher interface automatically for PRNGs
- Generic HMAC on our hash interface
* Eventual result
- Hopefully a client compatible with SSL 3.0
- Overlap:
  - RSA for key exchange
  - 3DES for cipher
  - SHA1 for data integrity
